            <p><h1> Overview of the Bhagavad Gita</h1><br> 
                The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata.
                It is a sacred text of the Hindu religion, written in the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the deity Lord Krishna, who serves as his charioteer.
                The Gita addresses the moral, ethical, and philosophical dilemmas faced by Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before a great war is set to begin.The Gita introduces the concept of the Atman, the eternal soul, which is distinct from the physical body. It teaches that the true self is immortal and cannot be destroyed, regardless of the fate of the body. The impermanence of the body and the eternal nature of the soul is a central theme that helps Arjuna overcome his hesitation about killing his kin in the war.

            <p><h2>Key Themes of the Bhagavad Gita</h2><br> 
                <b>2.1</b> Dharma (Righteous Duty)<br>
                The Gita stresses the importance of performing one's duty without attachment to the results. Arjuna is encouraged to fight, as it is his dharma as a warrior, regardless of personal loss.
                The concept of Svadharma (one’s own duty) is central, emphasizing the idea that each individual must act in accordance with their own role in life.<br>
                <b>2.2</b> Karma (Action and Consequences)<br>
                Karma refers to the law of cause and effect—every action has a consequence.
                Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his actions selflessly, without attachment to outcomes. This is known as Karma Yoga, the path of selfless action.<br>
                <b>2.3</b> Bhakti (Devotion)<br>
                The Gita highlights the importance of Bhakti, the path of devotion to God. Krishna teaches that sincere devotion and surrender to God lead to liberation and divine favor.<br>
                <b>2.4</b> Jnana (Knowledge)<br>
                The Gita also promotes Jnana Yoga, the path of knowledge and wisdom. Krishna explains the nature of the self (Atman) and the eternal, unchanging soul, contrasting it with the temporary nature of the physical body.

            <p><h2>Structure of the Bhagavad Gita</h2><br> <br> 
                The Gita is divided into 18 chapters that cover different aspects of philosophy and spiritual practice. These are grouped into three main sections:
                Karma Yoga (The Yoga of Action): Focuses on the right way to act.
                Bhakti Yoga (The Yoga of Devotion): Emphasizes the importance of devotion and love for the Divine.
                Jnana Yoga (The Yoga of Knowledge): Deals with the realization of the self and the supreme reality.
